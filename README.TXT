PROJECT TITLE: SMPL
VERSION or DATE: 1.0 March 1st, 2024
AUTHORS: Punthmuny Srun
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

	- Make sure to follow the syntax as this SMPL is syntax-sensitive 
	(so is every other programming language though!). 

	- Write your commands and save into a .txt file (further versions 
	will include other text file types and allow you to write your own 
	commands through the program itself).
	
	- The .txt file has to be in the TextFile folder. Otherwise, users
	have to manually change the fileName variable located in newMenu Class. 

	- Run the project and type in the name of the text file that you 
	put your commands in.
